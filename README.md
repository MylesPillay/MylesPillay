### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a junior front-end developer that loves working in React! I mainly have experience working with the following technologies:

I like to focus on writing clean, dry code and creating authentic user-friendly layouts. :grin: Here are some of the projects I've created so far!

An English to Morse Code Translator 

A Ticket-Counter Gallery

Brewdog Beers API

Connect-4 in JS

OAE-Event-Backend - this was a client project I worked on for Nology. I have created a repo highlighting what was acconplished in my area of the sprint. 


I am currently looking for an employer with a focus on React in their codestack as this is an area  where I feel I'll excel :computer:. If you would like to contact me please use the link below, or find me on LinkedIn! :)

When I'm not coding I'm usually writing music with my band Plastic Terras ![Spotify](https://img.shields.io/badge/Spotify-1ED760?style=for-the-badge&logo=spotify&logoColor=white), unnecessarily cooking something overly complicated :man_cook:, or just enjoying some down time on the sofa :tv:.
